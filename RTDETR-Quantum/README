This is the source code and some results from a modified version of the Ultralytics package with YOLO11 and RTDETR in it.

Please install Pennylane, Pennylane lightning, lightning tensor, pytorch and other standard requirements to use it.
Please also note that Nvidia CU-Quantum can help with this particular work, although it can in theory be used on AMD hardware in much the same way as the ordinary Ultralytics package can, this has not been tested at the time of writing.

It was developed on a RTX3090 GPU (and only 1 of it).

Finally please copy the neural network folder from here and then paste it into the ultralytics folder in order to use it, once that is done then you just need to type pip install ./path-to-ultralytics folder.
That will install the Ultralytics package with these modifications, but I would like to point out that I did not actually create the Ultralytics package, what I have done however is modify it to use certain simulated quantum circuits to attempt to improve its detection capabilities such as on the transformer layers such as the ones used in RTDETR (E.g. HGBlock).

Note that this does NOT contain the whole Ultralytics package at this time, but it does contain the necessary modified parts of it needed to make this algorithm work.
