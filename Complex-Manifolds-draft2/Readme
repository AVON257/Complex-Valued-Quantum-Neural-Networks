This is a new prototype of a complex manifolds algorithm that can calculate integrals and derivatives, using Toroidal coordinates and several complex
variables theory to do it, mainly using Hyperbolic methods to achieve this (although it can be adapted to use Parabolic, Elliptic or any combination
of these too). This is all going to be working using Nvidia CUDA (at the time this draft was created the version was 11.7, with g++-12 as the host compiler
on Ubuntu 22.04, using C++ 14 at most).

This software can be modified, distributed, or otherwise used as long as I can have the credit for what is used from it.

P.s. in its current form, please specify the
Vector elements, in Torus.hxx on the different coordinates.

Note that I will shortly be replacing this with one where you can either
Manually enter the data from keyboard input (for Cartesian coordinates), or
Read in a file.
