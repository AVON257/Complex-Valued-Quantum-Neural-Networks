This is a new prototype of a complex manifolds algorithm that can calculate integrals and derivatives, using Toroidal coordinates and several complex
variables theory to do it, mainly using Hyperbolic methods to achieve this (although it can be adapted to use Parabolic, Elliptic or any combination
of these too).
