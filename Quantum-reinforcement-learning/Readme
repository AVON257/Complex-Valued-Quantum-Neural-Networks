This file contains the results of what I have previously attempted to do, on reinforcement learning when the goal was to test trying reinforcement learning, using double-qubit rotation gates and complex valued tensors instead of real valued ones.
The work was carried out about 2 years ago, and I would very much like anyone who does use this to cite me as T.N.Toseland and the url shown here.
